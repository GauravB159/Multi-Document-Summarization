Tanushree Dutta has rightly been credited for spearheading the #MeToo movement in India, and the actor is in no mood to slow down. After taking on Nana Patekar, she is all set to take a legal battle against Vivek Agnihotri. The actor is now set to file a complaint with the police to register a complaint against the filmmaker as she, through her lawyer, claims that he 'confessed to his own crime' of sexually harassing her on the sets of the film 'Chocolate: Deep Dark Secrets' in 2005, as reported by a Mumbai-based tabloid. Tanushree's lawyer Nitin Satpute claims that Tanushree had not mentioned his name while talking to the press about the alleged incident. However, with Vivek sending across a notice to the actress where he mentioned that the 'director was none other than me', Satpute says Vivek 'confessed to his own crime.' He further revealed that that's the reason they will now approach the Oshiwara police station asking for an FIR to be registered against him on charges of molestation. The alleged incident took place on the sets of the film 'Chocolate: Deep Dark Secrets' in 2005 where Vivek allegedly told Tanushree to 'remove her clothes and dance', as stated by the actor in her interviews. She had then revealed that her co-stars in the film Irrfan Khan and Suniel Shetty had stood up for her and expressed annoyance at the director's statement. Tanushree is also in a legal battle with Rakhi Sawant and has filed a defamation suit against the item girl for Rs 10 crores for the comments she made against the former after she came back into the limelight with allegations against Nana. The 'Aashiq Banaya Aapne' girl also plans to file a police complaint against Rakhi for her comments. The actor had earlier filed an FIR against Nana Patekar for touching her inappropriately on the sets of the film 'Horn 'OK' Pleassss' in 2008. She has also mentioned the names of choreographer Ganesh Acharya, producer Samee Siddhiqui and Rakesh Sarang in the complaint.
