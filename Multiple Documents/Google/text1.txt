Google is urging more manufacturers to enable a new security feature in Android Oreo that detects if a device has been downgraded to an earlier version of the OS. Known as rollback protection, the measure adds another layer of security in the event a device is lost or stolen, and the attacker rolls it back to an older Android firmware with known vulnerabilities. Google revealed some details about rollback protection in September, which caught the attention of Android enthusiasts who like the freedom to downgrade Android as they see fit, even though it could be a security risk. While the security feature is part of Oreo, it's not available on every Android device that runs Oreo. According to Google, rollback protection works in tandem with Project Treble, the major redesign of Android in Oreo that separates the Android platform from vendor code. The modular design aims to help Android OEMs deliver new versions of Android to end-users faster. However, Project Treble is only supported on new devices that ship with Android, rather than devices that get upgraded to Oreo. So new handsets like the Pixel 2 and Sony Xperia XZ1 are Treble-compatible, while the Nokia 8 isn't.
