Security has long been a sore point for enterprise Android users, but Google has taken steps to improve security in the OS with Android Oreo. In a Wednesday blog post, the firm detailed a feature called rollback protection, which prevents a device from starting up if it has been downgraded to an older OS version that may contain security vulnerabilities. This means that if your business phone is stolen, it will be more difficult for a hacker to leverage security flaws found in a previous version of the OS and access your data. This could add piece of mind for IT professionals managing Android devices in the workplace. While rollback protection is part of Android Oreo, it is up to the individual manufacturers of Android devices to enable the feature, as noted by our sister site ZDNet. Rollback protection is part of Andriod Verified Boot 2.0 (AVB), designed to stop devices from starting up with software that has been altered by hackers, according to the blog post from security team member Gian G Spicuzza. AVB runs with Project Treble, a "major re-architect" of the Android OS framework meant to make it easier for manufacturers to update to new versions of the OS.
