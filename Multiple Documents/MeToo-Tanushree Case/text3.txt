Former beauty queen Tanushree Dutta's allegations against veteran actor Nana Patekar not only shocked the entire nation but it also started the #MeToo movement in our country. After filing an FIR against Patekar, Tanushree has now filed a fresh complaint with CINTAA asking them to take action on her complaint that she had filed in 2008. Her legal team has now filed a fresh complaint at CINTAA along with the new FIR attached to it, asking them to reopen the case."Tanushree's lawyer has sent us a mail asking us to start or reopen the case, we thought that she would send it herself as we had requested her,now we are consulting our legal cell as to what should be done as she has not even added a cover note, authorising her lawyer to represent her in her own association...hope you understand our quandary. She has also sent copy of her fresh FIR. We are just trying to handle this as correctly as we can, the police have taken her original complaint of 2008, along with all attached papers of that time & kept in their possession. Our General Secretary has also given his statement to the cops yesterday", read the fresh statement released by CINTAA.
