After former actress Tanushree Dutta opened up about sexual harassment allegations against Nana Patekar, a lot has changed since then. Nana is no more a part of Akshay Kumar's upcoming film 'Housefull 4', and the film's director Sajid Khan has also been dropped owing to multiple harassment allegations. But Tanushree doesn't feel vindicated as of now. The actress said that she is not celebrating yet because there is so much more that needs to be done. Tanushree is glad that somebody like Akshay finally decided to put his foot down and has chosen to not work with people accused of multiple harassment allegations. Tanushree is also happy that many production houses are taking a stand, but she would not want this to be a one-time thing. The 'Aashiq Banaya Aapne' is just seeing where this is going before she can raise a toast in celebration. However, the actress feels that whatever happened is a milestone as actors are taking a stand by disassociating themselves, the 'Housefull 4' fiasco, production houses like Phantom Films dissolving, MAMI dropping films, and concrete steps being taken are an encouraging thing. Earlier, it was only about her talking, then people supporting her, then more people coming forward with their stories, but now, Tanushree feels it's becoming an issue on the national level and structures are falling. She feels this is how more people will come forward to talk about such things and the victims need to be assured that they would be heard and their words would have an effect. Instead of sitting back after the success of the movement, Tanushree says that she wants to push the #MeToo movement, as there are many people with horrifying stories that are untold and need to come to light.
