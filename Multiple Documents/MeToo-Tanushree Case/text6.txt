After Tanushree Dutta renewed the conversation against her alleged harassment at the hands of Nana Patekar in 2008, the latter had announced that he will address the media in a press conference on Monday, October 8, 2018. Nana was busy shooting for his next film 'Housefull 4' in Jaisalmer. In a fresh development, Nana has reportedly cancelled the supposed press conference for today. Nothing has been revealed about when the media interaction will now take place. So far, Nana has denied all allegations against him and continued to do so even on his way back to Mumbai. Nana was quoted saying, "I have already answered... Jo jhooth hai woh jhooth hai (what is a lie is a lie)".
