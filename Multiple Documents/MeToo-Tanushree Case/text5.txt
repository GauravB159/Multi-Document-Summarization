Weeks after Tanushree Dutta accused veteran actor Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her on the sets of "Horn Ok Pleassss", the film's producer Samee Siddiqui, director Rakesh Sarang, Cine & TV Artists Association (CINTAA) member Raza Murad and former FTII chairperson Gajendra Chauhan were caught on tape mocking the actress and making sexist remarks. In a series of sting operations, Siddiqui was caught on tape saying, "Should I tell you the truth? I feel that day she was on her periods. So, you get irritated. Small touch or maybe something else, even I don't know what exactly happened because I wasn't there." Now, the producer's attorney, Kishore Gaikwad revealed in an interview that a notice will be sent saying that the complaint registered by Dutta is "not maintainable" citing that an FIR had already been filed. According to reports, he claims that it is "not proper" to register another FIR and went on to state that his client was not present on the sets when the incident took place, and that they deny all allegations in the complaint.
